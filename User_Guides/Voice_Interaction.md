"Lobe Chat supports Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) technologies, enabling our application to convert text messages into clear voice outputs, allowing users to interact with our conversational agent as if they were talking to a real person. Users can choose from a variety of voices to pair with the agent.

In the process of implementing this feature, we found that there was no satisfactory TTS (Text-to-Speech) frontend library available on the market. As a result, we invested a lot of effort, including data conversion, audio progress management, and speech visualization, among other tasks."
