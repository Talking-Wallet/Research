## On the structure of this research knowledge base

Creating a knowledge base for your AI-powered Bitcoin wallet with an automated concierge service is a fantastic idea, especially given the target audience of non-technical users. Here’s a structured approach tailored specifically for your product, along with guidance on how to organize it on GitHub.

        How to check balances.
        Security features (e.g., backup, recovery).
    AI Concierge Service:
        How to interact with the AI.
        Common tasks the AI can help with (e.g., transaction reminders, security tips).

C. Technical Documentation

    Architecture Overview: High-level view of the system architecture.
    API Documentation: If applicable, document any APIs used for the concierge service.
    AI Components: Overview of the AI algorithms and frameworks used, including how they enhance user experience.

D. Market Research

    Incident Response Plan: What to do in case of a security breach.

G. FAQs and Troubleshooting

    Common Questions: Address typical queries from users.
    Troubleshooting Guides: Step-by-step solutions for common issues.

2. Organizing the Knowledge Base on GitHub
A. Repository Structure

    Create a GitHub Repository: Start a new repository, e.g., ai-bitcoin-wallet-knowledge-base.
    Folder Structure: Organize your knowledge base into folders to make navigation easy:

    /docs
    ├── Overview.md
    ├── User_Guides
    │   ├── Getting_Started.md
    │   ├── Using_the_Wallet.md
    │   └── AI_Concierge.md
    ├── Technical_Documentation
    │   ├── Architecture.md
    │   ├── API_Documentation.md
    │   └── AI_Components.md
    ├── Market_Research.md
    ├── Regulatory_Compliance.md
    ├── Security_Practices.md
    └── FAQs_and_Troubleshooting.md

B. Markdown Files

    Use Markdown (.md) files for documentation to keep it readable and easily editable.
    Include images and diagrams as necessary to enhance understanding.

C. Version Control

    Utilize Git for version control. Encourage team members to create branches for significant changes and use pull requests for reviews.

D. Collaboration

    Issues and Discussions: Use GitHub Issues to track tasks, bugs, or feature requests. Utilize Discussions for team brainstorming.
    Wiki Option: Consider using GitHub Wiki for a more structured and navigable format if you prefer that over a folder-based setup.

3. Collaboration and Maintenance

    Regular Updates: Schedule regular meetings to review and update the knowledge base.
    Encourage Contributions: Promote a culture of contribution among team members. Use GitHub's contribution graph to track involvement.
    Feedback Loop: Implement a system for gathering feedback from both team members and potential users to continuously improve the knowledge base.

4. Additional Resources

    GitHub Actions: Consider implementing CI/CD for automated documentation updates or deployments.
    Markdown Editors: Use Markdown editors like Typora or Obsidian for drafting documents before pushing to GitHub.

Conclusion

By organizing your knowledge base in this structured manner on GitHub, you’ll create a valuable resource that not only aids your team in the development process but also serves as a guide for non-technical users as they navigate your AI-powered Bitcoin wallet. This approach ensures clarity and accessibility of information, fostering collaboration and continuous improvement.
